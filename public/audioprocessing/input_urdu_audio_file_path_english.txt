Respected friends and elders, what aspects of the life of Prophet Muhammad S.A.W. should be mentioned? Prophet Muhammad S.A.W. raised the slaves. Prophet Muhammad S.A.W. raised the women. Those who were living a life of humiliation. Those who were strangled. Those who were buried under the ground. Prophet Muhammad S.A.W. gave those women a life of respect and honour. Prophet Muhammad S.A.W. said, listen, these are your daughters, these are your sisters, these are your wives, these are your mothers. The reasons are different. The reasons are not humiliation and humiliation. You gave respect to your daughter. You gave respect to your sister. And you gave honour to your wife. And you put heaven under the feet of your mother. Our leader is great. Our leader is great. Your leadership and guidance is over. The house in which a daughter is born, the angels of mercy surround her. Whoever has one daughter or two daughters. This is a ticket to heaven. Many people have more daughters and are worried. No, no. Allah wants to elevate your status through daughters. He wants to elevate your status in heaven. And said, these sisters are a means of respect and honour for you. Serve them, you will get heaven. The elder sister is equal to the mother. He said about the wife that she is not your slave, she is not your servant. In fact, he praised his wife and said, The best of you is the one who is best for his wife. I am the best for my wife in all of you. The Prophet Muhammad s.a.w. told this and explained it. This great blessing that the Prophet Muhammad s.a.w. has given. And what is the matter of the mother? The heaven is under the feet of the mother. In comparison to the father, he has given three times his status. She keeps him in the womb. She goes through the stage of birth with worry. She gives him milk. And she is always worried about his life. And she is always full of love. The brother asks, what did you earn from the Gulf? The wife asks, how much money did you collect? But when a man reaches his home shivering, The mother wipes the sweat off his face with her scarf and says, Son, did you eat anything? The mother is a great blessing. That is why it is said that there is heaven under his feet. The Prophet Muhammad s.a.w. has given a high status. And remember, the Prophet Muhammad s.a.w. said, To practice Islam, to follow Islam, to win Islam. Where men and companions have worked, There is a high status of companionship. Who is this? This is Hazrat Khadija. Who congratulated the Prophet Muhammad s.a.w. Thousands of scholars are kept on one page. Hazrat Khadija will be on the other page. The one who consoled the Prophet of the time. The Prophet Muhammad s.a.w. used to say, Ayesha, what to ask about Khadija? When the world denied, she accepted me. When people rejected me, she gave me shelter. When people deceived me, she consoled me. Once Hazrat Jibreel came. And the Prophet said, where is Khadija? The Prophet said, she is inside. He said, tell Khadija that Allah sends him greetings. What is the status? The life and respect that has been given to women, The promise of Allah has been fulfilled through the Prophet Muhammad s.a.w. This is a part of this religion. Who does not know Hazrat Usmayyah? The first blood was shed in the path of Islam. Who does not know Hazrat Asma bin Abi Bakr? Who does not know Hazrat Safar Hijrat? Who does not know Hazrat Hafsa? Who does not mention the swords of Hazrat Umm Ammara, with which she fought in the battlefield of Wahd? Who does not mention Hazrat Umm Talha, who was hospitable? How high is her status? And Hazrat Khansa, who gave her four sons to Allah. All of them were martyred. These are the women of paradise, through whom religion has advanced. And when the Prophet Muhammad s.a.w. was leaving this world, The Prophet Muhammad s.a.w. passed away between this chest and thigh. The woman who gives consolation, The woman who leaves this world, Our mother. This is the religion of the Prophet Muhammad s.a.w. About which it has been said, You are in this world for a few days, You have to come to your Lord. The teachings of the Prophet Muhammad s.a.w. A big part of it is that, This is the world of means, This is the world of means, This is the world of hard work, This is not the world of means. Prayer is first, prayer is last. But remember my followers, Keep praying, keep doing dhikr and askar, But adopt means. The Prophet Muhammad s.a.w. would have sat in the Kaaba, If he had prayed, Kufr and shirk would have been destroyed. You would not have to fight. The polytheists of Mecca would not have attacked you. You would have prayed in the Kaaba, Everything would have been fine. But Allah s.w.t said, You are the Prophet of the world, You have to adopt means. You have to plan, You have to prepare good people with means. And through that, You have to conquer the religion of Allah. The Prophet Muhammad s.a.w. is in the Kaaba, A rope is wrapped around your neck, And it is tried to roll it. You are in prostration, The burden of prostration is placed on you. The Prophet Muhammad s.a.w. is in the field of Taif. The person who has not been born on this earth, Nor will he be born until the Day of Judgment. It is a part of the deep faith of our hearts. The Prophet Muhammad s.a.w. has a part of the rain of stones. In the field of Uhud, The Prophet Muhammad s.a.w. has a face of Noah. The blessed ones are martyred. As long as the Prophet Muhammad s.a.w. was on this earth, You will never live in peace on this earth. So that the Ummah is saved from hell. The Prophet Muhammad s.a.w. This is the life of Karbala. And it was said, O people who are afraid of troubles, Listen, My Prophet is the one who is a role model for the living world. When he does not come into this world, At that time, his father dies. A few days later, His mother dies. The grandfather who takes care of him, He also dies. Apparently, the situation is all Disappointing. But I am the one who is going to give the highest rank. The Prophet Muhammad s.a.w. only got girls. The enemies used to say, Their roots have been cut. The Qur'an said, O Prophet, do not worry. Their roots have been cut. And remember, The temperament of the whole world. And the temperament of ignorance. And even today, our temperament should change. The Qur'an has proven it. This Prophet Muhammad s.a.w. He is not the father of any of your men. He is the Seal of the Prophets. He only has girls. And girls get respect. Girls get honor. Those who had dozens of boys, They are not going to remember the world today. They are not going to remember the world today. They are cursed. But it was said, O Prophet Muhammad s.a.w. The rank you have received through these girls, Tell the world. The Prophet Muhammad s.a.w. He is the one who only had girls. But the Prophet Muhammad s.a.w. Thousands and millions of seconds do not pass. So that the whole world does not The rain of blessings on your blessed fast. This is the honor of Allah. This is the reward of Allah. Which he has given to the Prophet Muhammad s.a.w. Friends, we are the Ummah of the Prophet Muhammad s.a.w. Let's understand all these details and move forward. The Prophet Muhammad s.a.w. He has established justice on this earth. He has established justice on this earth. And the Prophet Muhammad s.a.w. That's why he was blessed. Where your big work was, The biggest of your work was to establish justice on this earth. We sent the Prophets to this earth. We sent books. We sent down the rules to establish justice on this earth. Just as all the Prophets came to establish justice on this earth. The Prophet Muhammad s.a.w. Came to establish justice in this world. When Fatima was caught stealing. And his hand was cut off. And the companions started the recommendation. So the Prophet said. The previous nations were destroyed. When a small man committed a sin. He used to cut off his hand. A big man committed a sin. He used to take the money and leave it. I swear to God that if my daughter Fatima steals. I will cut off her hand. The Prophet Muhammad s.a.w. Established a system. A system of justice. Today the world needs that system. Which the Prophet Muhammad s.a.w. Established in Medina. And after him, Hazrat Khalifatul Masih III. He advanced it. May Allah bless us all.
